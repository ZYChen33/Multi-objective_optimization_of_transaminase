## Requirements
To run the scripts provided in this repository, you'll need the following Python libraries:
- Python  3.6+
- scikit-learn >= 0.24.2
- scikit-optimize >= 0.24.2
- pandas >= 1.4.3
- numpy >= 1.24.4
- matplotlib >= 3.5.2
- pareto >= 1.0.0b2

## Installation Guide

You can install the required Python packages using the following commands: 
pip install <package_name>==<version_number>

For example, to install scikit-learn version 0.24.2, you would run:
pip install scikit-learn==1.0.2

Ensure you replace <package_name> with the name of the required library and <version_number> with the specific version you need. It's important to use the correct versions to ensure compatibility with the script.
